StripperDates is an app I wrote to help with one of my little side hustles (ActiveRecoveryMedical.com - i have a brick & mortar storefront where people can bring in their surplus unopened boxes of glucose monitoring strips, which i send to a national distributor which supplies discount pharmacies. - it's a 4 way win! my donors get some cash for what they would let become trash, i make a few dollars, the distributor makes a few dollars the discount pharmacy makes a few dollars and their customers get a huge discount compared to direct retail).
I run this app prior to opening my shop for the day. It takes the current date from the system and applies some math to determine the buying guidles for that day (acceptable expiration dates for purchases of boxes). then writes it to a simple text file on my desktop, which i review and then print on paper.
To use this program yourself, you'll need to edit line 18 to reflect the destination of your own system/username/folder/filename.txt - it's really easy to publish the app for windows (using visual studio 2022) as an exe you can run at will, (or drop it in your start-up folder)
